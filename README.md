## ü§ñ Use The Public Instance

Don't want to bother with hosting it yourself? You can add the official instance of the bot to your server with just one click.

*Note: The public bot is a shared resource. For the best performance and reliability, self-hosting is always recommended.*

### üöÄ Self-Hosting Guide

This guide is for running the bot using the pre-compiled releases. No development tools are required.

#### Prerequisites

- **Java 23 or higher:** You need Java installed to run the `.jar` file.
- **A running Lavalink Server:** This bot requires a connection to a Lavalink server. You can find public ones [here](https://lavalink-list.appujet.site/) or host your own.
- **A Discord Bot Token:** Create a bot application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Download the Bot**
    Go to the [**Latest Release Page**](https://github.com/LOLYAY-INC/LavMusicBot/releases/latest) on GitHub. Download the `.jar` file (e.g., `LavMusicBot-1.0.0.jar`) and save it to a new, empty folder where you want the bot to live.

2.  **Generate the Configuration File**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the bot, and run it for the first time with the following command:
    ```sh
    java -jar LavMusicBot-1.0.0.jar
    ```
    *(Replace `LavMusicBot-1.0.0.jar` with the actual name of the file you downloaded).*

    The bot will state that a new configuration file was created and then shut down. This is expected. You will now see a `settings.yml` file in the folder.

3.  **Edit the Configuration**
    Open the newly created `settings.yml` file with any text editor. Fill in your `discord-bot-token` and your `lavalink-*` details. **The bot will not start without these values.**

4.  **Run the Bot**
    Once you have saved your changes to `settings.yml`, run the exact same command again:
    ```sh
    java -jar LavMusicBot-1.0.0.jar
    ```
    This time, the bot will read your configuration and connect to Discord. Congratulations, your bot is now online!
    *Note: If you get Bad Audio on Mobile, That's an Issue with your Lavalink Server, as in my Testing turning the `resamplingQuality` of your Lavalink Server to `HIGH` fixed it.* 

5. **Command Line Arguments**
   The bot supports several command line arguments:
   ```
   -DEBUG                    # Enables debug logging
   -OVERWRITE_CONFIG         # Forces overwriting of the config file
   -NO_REGISTER_COMMANDS     # Skips registering slash commands
   ```
---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (settings.yml)

This `settings.yml` file will be automatically generated in the same folder as your `.jar` file after you run it for the first time. Open it and edit the values as needed.

### Guild Configuration Storage

The bot automatically creates a `guildconfigs` folder in the same directory as the jar file to store per-guild settings.
Each server gets its own JSON file (using the guild ID as the filename) that preserves settings like volume level,
repeat mode, and play count between bot restarts. These files are managed automatically and don't need manual editing.

```yaml
# ---------------------------------- #
#      LavMusicBot Config            #

# Your discord bot token, get it from https://discord.com/developers/applications

# Here's how to get it:
# 1. Sign up for a free account at https://www.musixmatch.com/
# 2. Log in to your MusixMatch account in your web browser
# 3. Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect)

# 5. In the left sidebar, expand 'Cookies' and select 'https://www.musixmatch.com'
# 6. Find the cookie named 'musixmatchUserToken'
# 7. Copy the token value (a long string of characters) and paste it below
musixmatch-user-cookie: "YOUR_MUSIXMATCH_USER_TOKEN"


# Enable of disable the live lyrics feature, it highlights the current line playing, only works with musixmatch

live-lyrics-enabled: true

# How many milliseconds to move the line earlier than the song, higher = line gets highlighted earlier
live-lyrics-ping-compensation: 10


# --- Do Not Edit Below This Line ---

## Configuration Options

### Basic Settings
- `discord-bot-token`: Your Discord bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- `default-volume`: Default volume level (1-100) for the bot when joining a new server

### Lavalink Configuration
- `using-nodes-json-file`: Set to `true` to use a nodes.json file for Lavalink configuration.
- `nodes-json-file`: Path to your nodes.json file (if using nodes.json)
- **OR**
- `lavalink-host`: Hostname or IP of your Lavalink server
- `lavalink-port`: Port of your Lavalink server
- `lavalink-secure`: Set to `true` for SSL/TLS (`wss://`) connections
- `lavalink-password`: Authentication password for your Lavalink server

### Permission Settings
- `permissions-enabled`: Enable/disable role-based permissions
- `whitelist-acts-as-blacklist`: When enabled, the whitelist becomes a blacklist
- `role-id-whitelist`: List of role IDs that are allowed (or denied) to use the bot

### Lyrics Configuration

- `lyrics-enabled`: Enable/disable lyrics functionality
- `musixmatch-user-cookie`: MusixMatch user token for lyrics
- `live-lyrics-enabled`: Check [live lyrics](#live-lyrics)
- `live-lyrics-ping-compensation`: Check [live lyrics](#live-lyrics)

## Live Lyrics

This feature highlights the current line playing, currently only works with MusixMatch.
Doesn't work if you are repeating a song, only the first playback works for now.
It's a great feature, check it out!

### Ping Compensation

The live lyrics feature highlights the current line playing, so it's important to make sure the line is highlighted at
the right time.
The `live-lyrics-ping-compensation` option allows you to adjust how many milliseconds to move the line earlier than the
song, higher = line gets highlighted earlier.
The default value is 10 milliseconds, which is a good balance between highlighting the line and not highlighting it too
early.

## Nodes.json File
Nodes.json is a file that contains a list of Lavalink servers if you want to use more than one, if not you can use the standard config options.
In the config file, you can set the `using-nodes-json-file` to `true` and provide the path to your `nodes.json` file.
If you do that then you can omit the `lavalink-host`, `lavalink-port`, `lavalink-secure`, and `lavalink-password` fields.
You can get single json config from https://lavalink-list.appujet.site/non-ssl
```yaml
using-nodes-json-file: true
nodes-json-file: "path/to/nodes.json"
```
### Example nodes.json
```json
[
  {
    "identifier": "Lavalink Server 1",
    "password": "secret",
    "host": "lava.example.com",
    "port": 1234,
    "secure": false
  },
  {
    "identifier": "Lavalink Server 2",
    "password": "pleaseletmein",
    "host": "lava.somthig.else",
    "port": 1234,
    "secure": true
  }
]
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
