## ü§ñ Use The Public Instance

Don't want to bother with hosting it yourself? You can add the official instance of the bot to your server with just one click.

*Note: The public bot is a shared resource. For the best performance and reliability, self-hosting is always recommended.*

### üöÄ Self-Hosting Guide

This guide is for running the bot using the pre-compiled releases. No development tools are required.

#### Prerequisites

- **Java 23 or higher:** You need Java installed to run the `.jar` file.
- **A running Lavalink Server:** This bot requires a connection to a Lavalink server. You can find public ones [here](https://lavalink-list.appujet.site/) or host your own.
- **A Discord Bot Token:** Create a bot application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Download the Bot**
    Go to the [**Latest Release Page**](https://github.com/LOLYAY-INC/LavMusicBot/releases/latest) on GitHub. Download the `.jar` file (e.g., `LavMusicBot-1.0.0.jar`) and save it to a new, empty folder where you want the bot to live.

2.  **Generate the Configuration File**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the bot, and run it for the first time with the following command:
    ```sh
    java -jar LavMusicBot-1.0.0.jar
    ```
    *(Replace `LavMusicBot-1.0.0.jar` with the actual name of the file you downloaded).*

    The bot will state that a new configuration file was created and then shut down. This is expected. You will now see a `settings.yml` file in the folder.

3.  **Edit the Configuration**
    Open the newly created `settings.yml` file with any text editor. Fill in your `discord-bot-token` and your `lavalink-*` details. **The bot will not start without these values.**

4.  **Run the Bot**
    Once you have saved your changes to `settings.yml`, run the exact same command again:
    ```sh
    java -jar LavMusicBot-1.0.0.jar
    ```
    This time, the bot will read your configuration and connect to Discord. Congratulations, your bot is now online!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (settings.yml)

This `settings.yml` file will be automatically generated in the same folder as your `.jar` file after you run it for the first time. Open it and edit the values as needed.
