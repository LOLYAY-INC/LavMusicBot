## ü§ñ Use The Public Instance

Don't want to bother with hosting it yourself? You can add the official instance of the bot to your server with just one click.

*Note: The public bot is a shared resource. For the best performance and reliability, self-hosting is always recommended.*

## üöÄ Self-Hosting Guide

Hosting the bot yourself gives you full control and the best performance.

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17 or higher:** You need a recent Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- **A running Lavalink Server:** This bot requires a connection to a Lavalink server to function. You can host one yourself or use a public service.
    - Find a list of public Lavalink servers [here](https://lavalink-list.appujet.site/).
    - To host your own, see the [official Lavalink repository](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink).
- **A Discord Bot Token:** You need to create a bot application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Configure `settings.yml`**
    Create a file named `settings.yml` in the root directory of the project and fill it with your details. A template is provided in the Configuration section below.

3.  **Build the Project**
    This project uses Maven to build. Run the following command in the root directory:
    ```sh
    mvn clean package
    ```
    This will create a `.jar` file in the `target/` directory.

4.  **Run the Bot**
    Execute the compiled JAR file to start your bot (replace the filename with your actual JAR file name).
    ```sh
    java -jar target/your-bot-name-1.0.0.jar
    ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (settings.yml)

Create this file and place it in the same directory where you run the bot's JAR file.

```yaml
